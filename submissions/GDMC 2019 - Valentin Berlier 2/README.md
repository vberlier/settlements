# GDMC 2019 - Valentin Berlier

> This is a Forge mod submission for the Generative Design in Minecraft Competition.

## Usage

After installing the mod, you'll be able to invoke the generator by running the `BuildSettlement` command.

```
/BuildSettlement <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>
```

The command shouldn't take more than a minute to complete. I recommend opening the output log when running Minecraft to make sure that the generator doesn't get stuck.

See the "Outline" pdf for more information about how the generator works.
